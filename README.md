# CVMap

This is a script that  takes (any) SVG graphics and allows to manipulate the text-tags. 
Intended use was to take a Mindmap created with Freemind summarizing my personal CV and add balloons and links 

## Basic useage: 
    - Create a mindmap with Freemind and export it as .svg
    - run cvmap (replace filename in the code - input interface is still missing)
    - Now you have got a .toml-file you can edit. Add any balloons and links. The format should be quite self-explaining.
    - Run cvmap once again, open the ..._with_balloons.svg and enjoy.
 
## Getting started
Just run the script and have a look at the example-folder. This script transforms examples/CVTintin.svg   to CVTintin_with_balloons.svg and to CVTintin.html.
Open the output files with your browser and you will find some links and pop-up-balloons.
